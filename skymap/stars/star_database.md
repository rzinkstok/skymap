# SkyMap's stellar database

The stars plotted in SkyMap all come from the Hipparcos, Tycho and Tycho-2 catalogues published by ESA:

* The Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogues (ESA 1997), http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?I/239
* The Tycho-2 Catalogue of the 2.5 Million Brightest Stars, Hog et al., Astron. Astrophys. 355, L27 (2000), http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?I/259
* Hipparcos, the new Reduction of the Raw data, van Leeuwen F., Astron. Astrophys. 474, 653 (2007), http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?I/311

For ease of use, these were converted to MySQL databases: all queries below are performed on these databases.

## Background

The Hipparcos catalogue (118,218 stars) was first published in 1997, together with the larger Tycho catalogue (1,058,332 stars). 
In 2000, the Tycho-2 catalogue was published, containing even more stars (2,539,913) at a slightly higher accuracy than Tycho-1.
For all practical purposes, the newer Tycho-2 supersedes the earlier Tycho catalogue (from now on, Tycho-1) completely. The
only exceptions is the variability data in Tycho-1: Tycho-2 does not say anything about that. For the 
Hipparcos catalogue, a new reduction of the raw data was published in 2007, bringing much more accurate astrometrics.

The astrometric accuracy of the Hipparcos catalogue is much better than that of the Tycho catalogues: for Hp < 9 mag, the median precision for the position 
is 0.77/0.64 mas (RA/dec), and for proper motion 0.88/0.74 mas/yr (RA/dec). The Tycho catalogue does not get better than
7 mas for stars with Vt < 9 mag. The photometric accuracy of Hipparcos is better as well: for Hp < 9 mag, the median photometric 
precision is 0.0015 mag, while Tycho-1 is limited to 0.012 mag (Vt).

## Structure of the databases

### Hipparcos
* Identifier: HIP
* Reference system: ICRS
* Position epoch: J1991.25
* Catalogue parts:
  * Main catalogue: astrometrics, photometrics
  * Double and Multiple System Annex (DMSA): component information for entries resolved into 2 or more components
  * Variability Annex: variability data

### Tycho
* Identifier: TYC1, TYC2, TYC3, HIP
* Reference system: ICRS
* Position epoch: J1991.25
* Catalogue parts:
  * Main catalogue

### Tycho-2
* Identifier: TYC1, TYC2, TYC3, HIP
* Reference system: ICRS
* Position epoch: J2000
* Catalogue parts:
  * Main catalogue
  * Supplement 1 (Hipparcos/Tycho-1 stars not in Tycho-2)
  * Supplement 2 (Tycho-1 stars either false or heavily disturbed)

## Combining the databases

In order to make use of the large number of stars in Tycho-2, but not lose out on the much more accurate data in Hipparcos,
it would be nice to combine the databases. However, this is not trivial, especially due to the multiplicity as indicated in 
Hipparcos. Tycho-1 does not indicate much about multiplicity: only a duplicity flag (T49) and the CCDM component identifier (T51) to
link to Hipparcos. Tycho-2 does not have a duplicity flag (one assumes all multiples in Tycho-1 were resolved in Tycho-2), but
does give the CCDM component identifiers. The new Hipparcos reduction gives information on the number of components, and the
solution type also indicates double stars: it seems that no new doubles or multiples are identified.

The general idea will be as follows:
* Use all Hipparcos data
* Use all data from Tycho-1 except Hipparcos stars (Tycho-1 stars with HIP number) and Tycho-2 supplement 2 stars
* Use all data from Tycho-2 except Hipparcos stars (Tycho-2 stars with HIP number); overwrite astrometrics and photometrics 
for Tycho-1 stars

Further data will come from other sources:
* Variability data from GCVS
* HD numbers
* Bayer, Flamsteed
* Proper names from IAU
* Constellation assignment (calculated)

Issues:
* Propagation of star positions to a common epoch using proper motion (maybe not required, considering the use case)
* Hipparcos double/multiple stars that are not resolved in Tycho-1 (5898 cases, see p. 159 of the *Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogue*; we ignore the Tycho-1 data for these stars)
* Hipparcos stars resolved into multiple Tycho-1 stars: this does not occur (only one of the stars is assigned the Hipparcus number)
* Tycho-1 stars that are resolved into multiple Tycho-2 stars: in this case, the additional component gets a new TYC3 identifier and the Tycho-1 data can be ignored
* Tycho-1 stars that are not found in Tycho-2: most of these have uncertain astrometrics (Q=9). 

### Hipparcos multiplicity

Where Tycho-1 and Tycho-2 have separate entries for each resolved component, Hipparcos is structured in a different way.
A Hipparcos star is part of a multiple system when:
* Its entry shares the CCDM identifier with one or more other entries
* It is resolved into separate components: it has one entry with number of components larger than 1
 
In the latter case, the components are described in part C of the DMSA, which deals with
component solutions. Other parts of the DMSA describe less clear solutions (acceleration terms, orbital solutions, 
variability induced movers and stochastic solutions). These are not counted as resolved.

This means multiple systems can be found by the following:
* Find all entries linked by a common CCDM identifier
* Find all entries with number of components greater than 1; these have a multiplicity flag equal to C, and their component data is found in part C of the Double and Multiple Systems Annex)

If required, dubious multiple systems can be found by looking at entries where the multiplicity flag is set but unequal 
to C (that is, G, O, V or X).

Using this method, all double and multiple systems can be found, grouped by the CCDM identifier. Incidentally, there are 
also entries with number of components equal to 1 that do have an entry in part C of the DMSA: these are always part of 
a multy-entry (multi-pointing) system.

In the language of the Hipparcos guide, systems are called two-pointing when two separate entries (two separate pointings
of the sattelite's detector) describe a system having two or more components, and the astrometrics of the system is solved using
the data of both entries combined. Three-pointing and four-pointing systems are defined similarly. Not all 
all entries linked by a common CCDM identifier are two-, three- or four-pointing: for some cases, the astrometrics are solved
for each entry separately.

presented. In order to get a feel of the data, the core numbers are reproduced here:

### Linking Hipparcos and Tycho-1

A simple join of the main Hipparcos file with part C of the DMSA would yield a complete list of all resolved stars in
Hipparcos: this is a list of 129,595 records. Every record in this list is uniquely identified by the HIP identifier 
and the CCDM component identifier. In principle, each of these records should correspond to an entry in the Tycho-1
database.

However, there are 5,898 entries in Hipparcos that contain 2 or 3 stars (specified in the DMSA) that are not resolved in 
Tycho-1, comprising 5,896 Hipparcos numbers. In Tycho-1, the m_HIP field contains both component IDs (AB, AC, etc) for
the double stars or TT for the three cases where it is a triple system, where the component IDs are in fact ABC. For
these unresolved systems, we ignore the Tycho-1 data.

The 263 stars in Hipparcos that have no proper astrometry are not found in Tycho, and are suppressed.

In order to generate a list of all individual stars in Hipparcos and Tycho-1, the following method is used:
* Left join Hipparcos main (excluding stars without proper astrometrics) to the DMSA part C yields all individual stars in Hipparcos; call this IndiHip
* Right join IndiHip and Tycho-1 on the HIP number and component ID, omitting all 5,898 unresolved entries where 
LENGTH(TRIM(m_HIP)) > 1; call this IndiHipTyc
* Add to IndiHipTyc the Hipparcos records for the unresolved doubles
* Add to IndiHipTyc the Hipparcos records for the unresolved triples


| Description                                    | Number    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------: |
| Stars in Tycho-1                               | 1,058,332 |
| Resolved Hipparcos stars in Tycho-1            | 1,052,434 |
| Hipparcos double stars not resolved in Tycho-1 |    11,790 |
| Hipparcos triple stars not resolved in Tycho-1 |         9 |

### Linking Tycho-2 data to the combined Hipparcos and Tycho-1 data

5281 Tycho-1 stars are not found in Tycho-2 main, supplement 1 or 2. Of these, 5075 stars have very low-quality astrometrics in
Tycho-1 (Q=9), and these are excluded from Tycho-2 altogether (see the *Guide to the Tycho-2 Catalogue*, paragraph 2.2).

The remaining 206 Tycho-1 stars not found in Tycho-2 are more mysterious: these appear
to be components that have acquired a different TYC3 identifier in Tycho-2. Take for example HIP 39607. In Tycho-1, this
star is resolved into two components: TYC 1935 132 1 and TYC 1935 132 2, corresponding to CCDM components A and B. In Tycho-2,
only TYC 1935 132 3 can be found, corresponding to CCDM component A. In supplement 1, TYC 1935 132 2 is found, corresponding
to CCDM component B. So it would appear that the A component moved from TYC3 = 1 to TYC3 = 3, while TIC1 = 1 is not used
anymore. It is assumed that the later Tycho-2 assignments are the correct ones, so the 206 Tycho-1 stars should be deleted from the Hipparcos/Tycho-1 dataset.

Perhaps also delete the 5075 stars with very poor astrometrics?

Tycho-2 supplement 2 stars are removed from the database, while Tycho-2 supplement 1 are ignore as these are present in Hipparcos and/or Tycho-1.

Tycho-2 main: add stars not in Hipparcos/Tycho-1.

```SQL
-- Tycho-1 stars found in Tycho-2
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
	SELECT TYC1, TYC2, TYC3 from tyc2_tyc2
    UNION
    SELECT TYC1, TYC2, TYC3 from tyc2_suppl_1
    UNION
    SELECT TYC1, TYC2, TYC3 from tyc2_suppl_2
) as t2 INNER JOIN hiptyc_tyc_main AS t1 ON t1.TYC1=t2.TYC1 AND t1.TYC2=t2.TYC2 AND t1.TYC3=t2.TYC3;

-- Tycho-1 stars not found in Tycho-2
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
	SELECT TYC1, TYC2, TYC3 from tyc2_tyc2
    UNION
    SELECT TYC1, TYC2, TYC3 from tyc2_suppl_1
    UNION
    SELECT TYC1, TYC2, TYC3 from tyc2_suppl_2
) as t2 RIGHT JOIN hiptyc_tyc_main AS t1 ON t1.TYC1=t2.TYC1 AND t1.TYC2=t2.TYC2 AND t1.TYC3=t2.TYC3 WHERE t2.TYC1 IS NULL;
```


## Alternative approach

Simply use the T flag and HIP identifier in Tycho-2 to filter out Hipparcos/Tycho-1 stars, and use the HIP identifier in Tycho-1 to filter out Hipparcos
stars.

* take all Tycho-2 main stars
* maybe remove stars with questionable astrometry?
* remove all stars with T flag, unless the TYC1/TYC2/TYC3 identifier is not found in Tycho-1
* remove all stars with a HIP number
* take all Tycho-1 stars unless found in Tycho-2 supplement 2 or Q=9
* remove all stars with a HIP number
* take all Hipparcos stars (components) unless found in Tycho-2 supplement 2 or astrometrics is bad; add TYC ids from Tycho-2
* merge the three sets of stars

```SQL

) AND HIP IS NULL;
