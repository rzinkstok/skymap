# Design

## Interfaces

* Drawable objects: should have a draw method 
  * Circle
  * Ellipse
  * Square
  * Rectangle
  * Line
  * Arc
  * ...
  
* Labelable objects 
  
  
  
## Map creation workflow
* Plot map area and gridlines
* Load objects from database (stars, galaxies, etc)
* Maybe precess objects and/or propagate proper motion
* Cluster objects (double/multiples), create composite object (replace the original objects with the composite object)
* Label objects
* Sort objects by decreasing brightness/size
* Loop over objects
  *
